Simple MC Maxwell-Boltzmann distribution of a Hydrogen gas

This was just a fun little experiment to generate/compare the Monte Carlo generated samples to the theoretical speed distribution. 
The utility being that this gives you an actual distribution of particles at the appropriate speeds. 

You can change the TEMP, ATOM_MASS, NUM_ATOMS to get an idea of how these affect the distribution. For instance, increasing mass will shift the mean speed lower.
